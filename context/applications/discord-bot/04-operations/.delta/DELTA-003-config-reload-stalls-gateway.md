# DELTA-003 - Runtime Config Reload Stalls the Gateway Supervisor

Status: open

## Divergence

A runtime config reload (`PUT /admin/config` with `reload: true`) persists and
activates the new revision, but the Gateway supervisor it starts never reaches
READY or RESUMED. Staging stays not-ready until the next deploy restarts the
Durable Object. A deploy always boots the supervisor to ready.

## VRS

The operations requirements expect config changes to converge without a
deploy: revisioned compare-and-swap config with reload, and gateway-aware
readiness (see [decision 0008](../.decisions/0008-separate-rollout-evidence.md)
for the evidence split). Reload convergence is part of the operational
admission evidence.

## Implementation

Observed on staging, 2026-09-26, releases `15642b3` through `2d383bb`:

- After a reload, `/readyz` returns 503 with `supervisorReady=false` and
  `gatewayHealthy=false`; journal, session and error checks stay true.
- Runtime status stays frozen: supervisor `resuming`, current attempt
  `connecting`, attempt 1, no `lastError`. Even a 30 s establishment deadline
  never fires.
- Every 5 s alarm tick logs `gateClaimed=false supervisor=resuming`: the gate
  is held by a supervisor fiber that exists but does not progress.

Three fixes did not resolve it live: waking a tick inline after reload,
handing the restart to the Durable Object alarm, and bounding Gateway
establishment. The bounded establishment and alarm handoff are kept because
they remove real defects; the stalled-fiber cause is not yet identified.

Until resolved, config changes on staging are applied by deploy, not reload.

## Direction

update implementation

## Resolution Signal

A same-config reload on staging returns `/readyz` to 200 with all checks true
within the establishment deadline, twice in a row, with the `[bot-state]` tail
showing the post-reload supervisor reaching READY or RESUMED.
